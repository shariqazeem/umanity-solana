Tips Program:      5hkEjoNLyEpgKezYBvU2HF1FgBHfKGqumBaT48moUwqJ
```

## 🌐 Open Your App

```bash
# Already running at:
http://localhost:3000
```

**Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000**

## 🎯 Test Locally (Without Deploying)

Right now you can:
1. ✅ View the frontend UI
2. ✅ Connect wallet
3. ✅ See all 3 tabs (One-Tap, Pools, Tips)
4. ✅ Browse donation pools
5. ✅ View registration flow

## 📱 Deploy to Devnet (Next Step)

When you're ready to test with real transactions:

```bash
# 1. Check your SOL balance
solana balance

# 2. Get devnet SOL if needed
solana airdrop 2

# 3. Deploy programs
anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet

# 4. Programs will be deployed and you'll see:
# Program Id: ABC123... (donations)
# Program Id: DEF456... (tips)

# 5. IMPORTANT: Update the program IDs
# Edit these files with your deployed IDs:
# - programs/umanity-donations/src/lib.rs (line 4)
# - programs/umanity-tips/src/lib.rs (line 4)
# - Anchor.toml

# 6. Rebuild
anchor build

# 7. Your app is live on devnet!
```
