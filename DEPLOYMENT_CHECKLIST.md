# ðŸš€ Deployment & Submission Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Checks

### Code Quality
- [x] All features working (donations, pools, tips, leaderboard, activity feed)
- [x] No console errors in browser
- [x] No alert() dialogs (all inline messages)
- [x] Responsive design on mobile
- [x] All links work
- [ ] Test with 2-3 different wallets
- [ ] Verify all transactions on Solscan

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Supabase project created
- [ ] Tables created (run `supabase-schema.sql`)
- [ ] Environment variables set (if using Supabase)
- [ ] Treasury wallet has funds for testing

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy to Vercel (10 minutes)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI (if not already)
npm i -g vercel

# Build the project
npm run build

# Deploy
vercel

# Follow prompts:
# - Link to existing project or create new
# - Set project name: umanity-solana
# - Deploy to production: Yes
```

**After deployment:**
- [ ] Test live URL
- [ ] Connect wallet works
- [ ] Make a test donation
- [ ] Check leaderboard populates
- [ ] Verify activity feed shows transactions

### 2. Get Devnet SOL for Treasury

```bash
# Get public key
solana-keygen pubkey ~/.config/solana/umanity-treasury.json

# Visit faucet
# https://faucet.solana.com
# Request 5 SOL
```

### 3. Seed Demo Data (Optional but Recommended)

**Have 2-3 friends help:**
1. Each person connects their wallet
2. Register a profile with fun username
3. Make 1-2 donations (small amounts)
4. Send 1-2 tips to each other
5. This populates leaderboard and activity feed

**Why this matters**: Empty leaderboards look bad. Having real activity shows the product works.

## Submission Form

### Information to Prepare

**Project Name:** Umanity

**Tagline:** Gamified philanthropy on Solanaâ€”give, earn, govern

**Category:** DeFi / Social Impact / Creator Economy

**Description (500 words max):**
```
Umanity is a gamified donation platform on Solana that rewards every act of giving with points that convert to future governance tokens. We solve three major problems with traditional donation platforms:

1. High Fees: GoFundMe charges 5-10%, Patreon takes 8-12%. We charge zero.
2. Slow Processing: Traditional platforms take 3-5 business days. Solana confirms in <1 second.
3. No Donor Incentive: Donors get nothing back. We give them reward points that convert to tokens.

Our platform has three core features:

ONE-TAP DONATIONS: $2 instant donations with a single click. Perfect for impulse giving. Earn 10 points per donation.

CUSTOM POOLS: Donate any amount to specific causes (medical, education, disaster relief, clean water). Earn 1,000 points per SOL donated. Every transaction is verifiable on Solscan.

COMMUNITY TIPS: Peer-to-peer tipping for creators and community members. Optional registrationâ€”anyone can tip, but only registered users receive tips and appear on the leaderboard.

The gamification is the key innovation. Every SOL donated or tipped earns 1,000 reward points. At token launch, 100 points = 1 governance token. Token holders will:
- Vote on which charities get verified
- Decide platform fee structure
- Earn staking rewards
- Get early adopter perks

We built on Supabase to store user profiles, reward points, and transaction metadata. This keeps costs low while we accumulate points off-chain. At token launch, we'll convert points to SPL tokens via merkle tree airdropâ€”provably fair and transparent.

The business model: zero fees during user acquisition, then optional 1% fee for charity verification. Token holders govern fee decisions. Long-term, we add premium features (custom charity pages, analytics dashboards, matching campaigns).

Why we'll win: We're solving a real problem in a $485B market. Crypto philanthropy is growing 300% YoY, but no platform gamifies it properly. We make giving sticky through rewards, social proof (leaderboards), and future governance.

This is a fully working prototype on Solana devnet, ready for mainnet deployment. We have three major features, a clear path to revenue, and a scalable architecture. With more time, we'd add USDC support, Solana Actions, and mobile apps.

The future: Umanity becomes the default way web3 gives to charityâ€”transparent, instant, rewarding.

## Need Help?

**Common Issues:**

**Vercel deployment fails:**
- Check `next.config.js` is correct
- Ensure all imports are valid
- Run `npm run build` locally first

**Supabase connection errors:**
- Verify `.env.local` has correct credentials
- Check Supabase tables exist
- Ensure RLS policies allow access

**Wallet won't connect:**
- Make sure you're on devnet
- Try different wallet (Phantom vs Solflare)
